# ===================================================================================
# DOMAIN JOIN PROJECT - Consolidated Inventory Structure
# ===================================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Single inventory file defining all hosts across all domains
#   Clean Gemini-style approach for maximum scalability
#
# STRUCTURE:
#   - Domain groups (xxxx_xxx) contain OS-specific children
#   - OS groups (xxxx_xxx_linux, xxxx_xxx_windows) contain actual hosts
#   - Each domain has its own group_vars file for domain-specific settings
#   - Each OS type has its own group_vars file for OS-specific settings
#
# USAGE:
#   ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini --tags domain_join
#   ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini --limit xxxx_xxx_linux
# ===================================================================================

# =========================================================================
# DOMAIN: xxxx.xxx
# The 'xxxx_xxx' group is a container for its children groups
# All hosts here will inherit variables defined in group_vars/xxxx_xxx.yml
[xxxx_xxx:children]
xxxx_xxx_linux
xxxx_xxx_windows

# =========================================================================
# OS GROUP: xxxx Linux Targets
# Connection settings (ansible_connection, ansible_python_interpreter, ansible_ssh_common_args)
# are defined in group_vars/xxxx_xxx_linux.yml and apply to all hosts in this group
[xxxx_xxx_linux]
ansible-test-machine-01 ansible_host=xx.xx.xxx.x ansible_user=root

# =========================================================================
# OS GROUP: xxxx Windows Targets
[xxxx_xxx_windows]
# Add Windows hosts here as needed
#
# =========================================================================
# RUNNER GROUP
# GitHub Actions runner (for connectivity tests)
[runner]
localhost ansible_connection=local

# =========================================================================
# ALL SERVERS GROUP
# All servers (excluding runner - it's only for connectivity tests)
