# Domain Join Role Defaults
# Default values for domain join operations
# All values should be defined in inventory group_vars
# These are just fallbacks

# Domain settings - loaded from inventory
# domain_name: defined in group_vars/xxxx_xxx.yml
# domain_admin_user: defined in group_vars/xxxx_xxx.yml (from secrets)
# domain_admin_password: defined in group_vars/xxxx_xxx.yml (from secrets)

# CRITICAL: Variable name mapping for task compatibility
# Tasks use 'admin_user' and 'admin_password' for simplicity
# Inventory uses 'domain_admin_user' and 'domain_admin_password' for clarity
# This mapping bridges the gap

# Linux packages for domain join
# NOTE: This is defined in inventory/group_vars/xxxx_xxx_linux.yml
# The inventory value takes precedence - this is just a fallback for other environments
